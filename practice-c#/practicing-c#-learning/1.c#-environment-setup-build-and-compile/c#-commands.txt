C# Command Line For Working With C#
===================================
1) Check For Version  -   $ dotnet --version 
2) Check Template Setup - $ dotnet new search [template/folername]
3) Complie A File - 
	a) With .dll builder - 
		$ dotnet build -o [foldername] -- compiled filed with be stored there
		$ dotnet run /[foldername]/[.dll] file

	b) With Single Command -
		$ dotnet run [.cs] file


4) Create a template -
	$ dotnet new console -n [template/foldername]

5) Build Server -
	$ dotnet build-server 

6) Run a server watch mode -
	$ dotnet run watch 


7) Run Specific C# File -

   The dotnet run command is typically used to run an entire project, not just a single file. If you want to run a 
   specific C# file, you can use the dotnet script tool. Make sure you have it installed:

	$ dotnet tool install -g dotnet-script

   After installing dotnet-script, you can run your specific file using:

	$ dotnet script 2.Setup-C#-Program/C#-Namespace-Setup/Program.cs

  Ensure that your C# file has the necessary using statements and a Main method. The dotnet script tool simplifies the 
  process of running C# scripts directly without the need for a full project setup.
